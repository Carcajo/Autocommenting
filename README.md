<h2>
  Autocommenting
</h2>
  <p>In this project, a usbot is implemented using the program library for parsing Telegram posts and commenting on filtered posts in order to attract new customers to your channel/public.<p>
  <p>The program tracks the necessary channels, looks at information from Google Sheets and comments on a post filtered through written promts in Discussion chats. Comments are carried out using Cheat GPS, which writes a comment based on our requirements.<p>

In this project the following files:
<ul>
 <li>main.py - executable file</li>
 <li>functions.py - functions of this program</li>
 <li>promts.py - filters for posts and responses to them</li>
</ul>
